#✅ 1. Technical Explanation (For Engineers, PMs, Data Scientists)

The AI Ethics & Bias Review Framework is a web-based tool designed to assess machine learning models for bias, fairness, and ethical compliance throughout the ML lifecycle. It allows users to upload model metadata, evaluation metrics, or dataset summaries, and runs these through a customizable audit process based on fairness metrics like Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, and Disparate Impact.

The frontend is built using React and deployed on Vercel with a clean, minimalistic UI. The backend uses Node.js (or any API layer of your choice) to process model data, and integrates with open-source tools like IBM AI Fairness 360, SHAP, or LIME to generate explainability and fairness reports. Reports are shown in a dashboard-style interface with interactive visualizations.

It also includes:

A Bias Audit Checklist that guides teams through model documentation, data review, and evaluation steps.

A Reporting Template Generator that standardizes outputs for compliance or internal review.

GDPR & EU AI Act compliance guidance, allowing alignment with legal regulations for high-risk AI systems.

This framework is designed to be modular and extendable, so organizations can plug it into their MLOps pipeline or use it as a standalone governance tool for model reviews.

#✅ 2. Non-Technical Explanation (For Business Leaders, Stakeholders, Clients)

This product is a tool that helps companies make sure their AI models are fair, ethical, and legal. It checks whether an AI system is making decisions that might be unfair to certain groups of people — for example, by favoring one gender or race over another — and helps you spot and fix those problems.

Think of it like a "safety inspection for AI". Just like you’d check a car before selling it, this tool checks AI models before they’re used to make important decisions like hiring, loan approvals, or medical diagnoses.

It provides:

A simple checklist to walk through what needs to be reviewed.

A clear report that shows if the model is biased or risky.

An easy-to-use web interface where team members can collaborate and document their findings.

Advice to help meet AI regulations in Europe and beyond (like GDPR or the new EU AI law).

You don’t need to be a data expert to use it — the goal is to make ethical AI accessible and manageable for teams of all sizes.
